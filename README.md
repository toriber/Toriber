## Hello there, I'm <em>Bernardo Recabarren<em>! 👋
##### I'm a Mathematic Civil Engineer, with a Master in Mathematics from Valparaiso, Chile. Right now I'm working at Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional (the Chilean ISO).


A little about me
```python
class Bernardo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.code=['Python','C','Fortran (?)']
        self.tools=['Jupyter','Latex','SQL']
        self.ongoing='Just keep working, maybe a future PhD?, idk'
    def coffee(self):
        print('Agradecido, toma un teorema.')
        self.make_theorem()
    def make_theorem(self):
        #Abstrac nonsense#
```

## About myself 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some top secret projects 🕵️
- 🌱 My math interests are mainly Optimization, Optimal Transport and some Optimal Control. (If you say Wasserstein Flows, I'm in.)

- ⚡ Fun facts:
    * I'm Chilean (I speak Spanish, but also chilean hehe, <em>buena hueón!<em>).
    * I'm trying to learn French, and I could talk fluently English (B2).
    * "A really funny joke here"


## Let's get serious

- If you are here in a "code work" mood, you might be interested in looking at my [Work-CV 📄](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjG_Zq0gHPBAoAlI6JOaIabwSKt6lZ-U/view?usp=sharing).

- If you are in a "optimal" mood, maybe my [thesis 📖](https://repositorio.usm.cl/bitstream/handle/11673/54652/m19689563-9.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), about Optimal Transport could interest you. Feel free to reach me about any comments.
